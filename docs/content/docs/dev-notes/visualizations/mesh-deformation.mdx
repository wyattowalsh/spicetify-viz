Transforms a 3D mesh into a living sculpture that twists, pulses, and deforms in sync with the music. This visualizer gives sound a tangible, physical presence, turning your audio into a piece of generative, sonic architecture.

-   **Description:** This visualizer uses a WebGPU-powered pipeline to deform the vertices of a 3D mesh in real-time. The deformation is not a simple, single effect; it's a stack of programmable layers, allowing for complex, emergent behaviors.
-   **Use Case:** Provides a tangible, sculptural feel to the music. It can create anything from a subtly breathing object to a wildly chaotic, procedurally generated landscape that is a direct physical manifestation of the sound.

<Callout title="Technical Details">
-   **Performance Profile:** CPU: Low / GPU: Medium to High. Performance is dependent on vertex count, material complexity, and the number of deformation layers.
-   **WebGPU-Centric Deformation:** The core logic resides in a custom **vertex shader**. On each frame, the full audio frequency spectrum (FFT) is uploaded to a WebGPU `Storage Buffer`. This buffer is made available to the vertex shader via a `Bind Group`. The shader then executes a series of deformation algorithms, defined by the `deformationLayers` array, using the audio data to drive displacement vectors. This all-GPU approach enables complex, high-fidelity deformation on high-poly meshes at 60 FPS. The fragment shader handles Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) for realistic materials.
