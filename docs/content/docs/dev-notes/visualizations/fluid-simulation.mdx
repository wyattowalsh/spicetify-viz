A cutting-edge, GPU-accelerated visualizer that simulates the complex, organic motion of fluid dynamics in real-time. This is where computational physics meets generative art. Audio-driven forces are injected into a virtual fluid volume, creating beautiful, ever-evolving patterns of swirling color that flow with the music.

-   **Description:** This visualizer leverages a WebGPU-based GPGPU pipeline to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow entirely on the GPU. Audio features (like frequency band energy or transient hits) act as impulse forces applied to the fluid's velocity and density fields, creating mesmerizing, swirling patterns that are inextricably linked to the sound.
-   **Use Case:** The ultimate ambient experience. It generates infinitely complex, non-repeating, organic visuals that perfectly flow with the music. It is especially powerful for electronic, ambient, classical, and experimental genres where nuance and texture are key.

<Callout title="Technical Details">
-   **Performance Profile:** CPU: Very Low / GPU: High to Extreme. This effect is exceptionally demanding. The simulation `resolution` and `precision` have a significant impact on performance.
-   **GPGPU Pipeline:** This visualizer uses a series of WebGPU **compute shaders** to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow in a feedback loop. All data (velocity, pressure, density fields) persists entirely in GPU texture memory.
    1.  **Force Injection:** Audio data (beat, amplitude, frequency) and user interactions are translated into forces. This "splats" new velocity and color/density into the simulation textures.
    2.  **Advection:** A shader moves the density and velocity values through the velocity field itself, causing the fluid to flow.
    3.  **Divergence Calculation:** A shader computes the divergence of the velocity field. This measures how much fluid is "piling up" in any given cell.
    4.  **Pressure Solving:** A highly parallel compute shader solves the Poisson equation for the pressure field. This is typically done iteratively using the Jacobi method for a fixed number of `iterations`. This step is crucial for enforcing incompressibility.
    5.  **Gradient Subtraction:** The pressure gradient is subtracted from the velocity field, removing divergence and making the flow realistic.
    6.  **Rendering:** A final full-screen fragment shader reads from the resulting density texture (and optionally the velocity texture) to render the fluid to the screen, often applying post-processing effects like bloom and sunrays.

#### Configuration Options
<CodeBlock title="config/fluid-simulation.ts">
```ts
