Unleashes a torrent of thousands of dynamic particles, creating a swirling, energetic system that ebbs and flows with the music. This is not just a particle system; it's a generative engine for creating emergent, complex behavior from a set of simple, stackable rules. From gentle ambient fields to explosive sonic novas, you are the choreographer.

-   **Description:** This visualizer uses a modular GPGPU engine to simulate and render vast quantities of particles. The system is built on two core concepts: **Emitters**, which define where and how particles are born, and **Forces**, which define the physical influences that guide their movement.
-   **Use Case:** Creates an atmospheric and highly engaging visual experience. It can be configured for anything from a subtle, calming starfield to a chaotic, explosive nebula or a structured, flowing river of light.

<Callout title="Technical Details">
-   **Performance Profile:** CPU: Low / GPU: Very High. Performance is directly tied to particle count.
-   **GPGPU Pipeline:** This visualizer leverages **WebGPU compute shaders** to offload all physics calculations.
    1.  **State Buffers:** Particle data (position, velocity, age, etc.) is stored in a pair of `Storage Buffers`. These are used in a "ping-pong" configuration: on each frame, the compute shader reads from one buffer and writes the updated state to the other.
    2.  **Compute Step:** A compute shader is dispatched with one thread per particle. It integrates all active `Forces` (gravity, noise, audio-reactivity) to calculate the particle's new state. If a particle's life has expired, it is reset based on the properties of one of the `Emitters`.
    3.  **Render Step:** A separate render pipeline draws the particles using a single instanced draw call. A small base geometry (like a quad) is instanced `particleCount` times. The vertex shader reads the per-instance data directly from the updated storage buffer, positioning each particle correctly. This is the most efficient method for rendering massive quantities of objects.

#### Configuration Options

```ts

    // For 'vortex': Creates a rotating force field.
    position?: [number, number];

    // Which audio feature drives the force.
    frequency?: 'bass' | 'mid' | 'treble' | 'volume' | 'beat';
    // How the audio affects particles.
