# Contribution Workflow

All contributions must follow the strict, automated workflow detailed in `[publishing.mdx](mdc:docs/content/docs/dev-notes/publishing.mdx)`.

- **Conventional Commits**: All commit messages **must** follow the Conventional Commits specification. This is non-negotiable as it drives the automated release process.
    - `feat`: For new features (triggers MINOR release).
    - `fix`: For bug fixes (triggers PATCH release).
    - `perf`: For performance improvements (triggers PATCH release).
    - `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `!` in the type/scope: For breaking changes (triggers MAJOR release).
- **Pull Requests**: The PR title **must** also be a valid Conventional Commit message. PRs are squashed and merged, making the PR title the final commit message on the `main` branch.
- **Testing**: All new features and fixes must be accompanied by tests using Vitest. It is **mandatory** to verify visual/functional changes on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Code Quality**:
    - `pnpm lint` must pass.
    - The use of `any` is strictly forbidden. Use `unknown` with type-safe validation (e.g., Zod).
