A journey down an infinite, glowing grid into a synthwave horizon. This visualizer creates the quintessential retro-futuristic landscape that undulates and pulses to the beat, complete with procedurally generated digital mountains and a full suite of analog-inspired post-processing effects.

-   **Description:** Renders an infinite, scrolling perspective grid that deforms in real-time to the audio. The scene can be populated with distant, procedurally generated mountains, a synthwave sun, and a starfield, all drenched in atmospheric fog and retro visual artifacts.
-   **Use Case:** Perfect for synthwave, electronic, or any music that calls for a nostalgic, stylized, and immersive journey into a digital world.

<Callout title="Technical Details">
-   **Performance Profile:** CPU: Low / GPU: Medium to High, depending on post-processing effects.
-   **How It Works:** This is a 3D scene rendered with WebGPU. The "infinite" grid is an illusion created by two large grid planes that leapfrog each other as the camera moves. Audio data is passed as a `uniform` to the vertex shader, which displaces the grid's vertices to create a terrain-like surface. Post-processing effects like bloom, scanlines, and chromatic aberration are applied as full-screen shader passes after the main scene is rendered.

#### Configuration Options
<CodeBlock title="config/retro-grid.ts">
```ts
export interface RetroGridOptions {
  // --- Grid ---
  gridLineColor: string; // e.g., '#ff00ff'.
  gridLineWidth: number;
  gridDensity: number; // Number of lines in the grid.
  gridStyle: 'solid' | 'dashed' | 'points';
  scrollSpeed: number; // Base speed at which the grid scrolls towards the camera.
  
  // --- Mountains ---
  showMountains: boolean;
  mountainColor: string;
  mountainCount: number; // Number of mountain ranges.
  mountainHeight: number; // Max height of the mountains.
  mountainRoughness: number; // Ruggedness of the terrain (controls noise frequency).

  // --- Camera ---
  perspective: number; // Field of view. Higher values create a more extreme, wide-angle perspective.
  cameraShake: {
    // Shakes the camera in response to audio.
    frequency: 'bass' | 'beat' | 'none';
    strength: number; // Max strength of the camera shake.
  }

  // --- Scene & Atmosphere ---
  showSun: boolean;
  sunColor: string;
  sunRadius: number;
  showStarfield: boolean; // Adds a procedural, scrolling starfield.
  fog: boolean; // Adds distance-based fog for atmospheric depth.
  fogColor: string;
  fogDensity: number; // How quickly the fog becomes opaque.

  // --- Reactivity ---
  reactivity: {
    // What drives the height/waviness of the grid lines.
    gridWaviness: 'volume' | 'bass' | 'beat' | 'none';
    // Allows different frequencies to control waviness on different axes.
    wavinessAxis: 'x' | 'y' | 'z' | 'all';
    // What drives the height of the mountains.
    mountainAmplitude: 'volume' | 'bass' | 'beat' | 'none';
    // Music feature that modulates scroll speed.
    scrollSpeedModifier: 'volume' | 'tempo' | 'none';
  };

  // --- Post-Processing Effects ---
  bloom: boolean; // Adds a neon glow effect.
  bloomIntensity: number;
  // Adds horizontal lines for a CRT monitor look.
  scanlines: boolean;
  scanlineDensity: number; // How many scanlines are visible.
  scanlineOpacity: number; // Opacity of the scanlines.
  // Adds a retro lens distortion effect.
  chromaticAberration: boolean;
  chromaticAberrationIntensity: number; // How strong the color separation is.
}
