## Development Workflow

Here's the core workflow for making a code contribution.

1.  **Find an Issue:** Look for an open issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/your-username/spicetify-viz/issues) that you'd like to tackle. If you have a new idea, create an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.

2.  **Set Up Your Environment:** Follow the [**Development Setup Guide**](./dev-notes/setup) to get your local environment configured.

3.  **Understand the Architecture:** Before diving into the code, read the [**Architecture Overview**](./dev-notes/architecture) to understand how the project is structured. This will save you a lot of time.

4.  **Create a Feature Branch:**
    ```bash
    # Branch from the 'main' branch
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature
    ```

5.  **Make Your Changes:** Write your code, ensuring you follow the project's coding standards. If you're creating a new visualizer, follow the [**Creating Visualizations Guide**](./dev-notes/creating-visualizations).

6.  **Test Your Changes:** Run the test suite to ensure your changes haven't introduced any regressions.
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```

7.  **Commit and Push:** Use the [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for your commit messages. This is required for our automated release process. Push your branch to your forked repository.

8.  **Open a Pull Request:** Open a PR from your branch against the `main` branch of the main repository. Fill out the PR template, describing your changes clearly. A maintainer will then review your work.
